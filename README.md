# Transfer learning for COVID-19 detection
SARS-COV-2 constitutes a novel virus with a relatively high infection rate [2].
As such, early and effective detection is needed in order to track and impede the
spread of the pandemic. We propose a Deep Learning approach for detecting
COVID-19 based on X-ray images. Aside from detection, our network provides
insight about the affected area, the core locations of infection and how similar diseases are when represented by networks. Our findings illustrate promising results
both in localisation as well as AUC, reaching a ROC curve performance of 0.88 on
the COVID-19 X-ray Dataset. Our report also analyses the importance of Transfer
Learning, Model Architecture and Data Pre-processing.
